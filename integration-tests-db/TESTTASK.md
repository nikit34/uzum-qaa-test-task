# Exercise
1. Create a database similar to the one presented in this directory
2. Populate the database and write the same Java tests as the tests in this directory.
3. Rewrite hardcoded test data to generate for the database
# Note
- You can complete 3 part of the task at once, or stop at 2 part of the task, in which case fewer points will be given.
- The task will be assessed on the quality of the code and the scalability of the solution, and not on the number of tests.
- The main goal is to cover with tests the same thing that is already covered in golang
